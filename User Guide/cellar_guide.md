![Load dataset](datasetMenu.png)

In this tab, users can either upload their own single cell gene expression data
as a _csv_ or _h5ad_ file, with rows corresponding to cells and columns corresponding
to genes. For gene ids, please make sure they are either in _HGNC_, _entrez ID_, or _ENSEMBL_ format.

Clicking the **Load Dataset** button loads the dataset into the app for use.
